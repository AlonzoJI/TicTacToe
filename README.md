# TicTacToe
Game of tic-tac-toe that I created during the PREFACE Summer Bridge Program with The Ohio State University. I was given a limited amount of time to make a functional game of tic-tac-toe and needed to present the finished project during a live presentation in front of industry partners and staff from the College of Engineering.
